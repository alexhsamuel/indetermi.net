  <h3>Introduction</h3>
 
  <p>PyHEP is a set of <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>
  packages and extension modules to provide support for high energy
  physics data analysis in Python.  PyHEP is written by <a
  href="http://www.hep.caltech.edu/~samuel">Alex Samuel</a>, <a
  href="mailto:alex@alexsamuel.net"><tt>alex@alexsamuel.net</tt></a>.
  </p>

  <p>Why Python?  I have written down some of the reasons I have given
  up PAW and Root, and written PyHEP (and not SchemeHep, TclHep,
  PerlHep, or yet another C++ HEP library) <a
  href="why-python.html">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Currenly, the major components of PyHEP include are:
   <ul>
    <li>one- and multidimensional histograms</li>
    <li>flat-format data tables, similar to "ntuples" in other HEP
    packages</li>
    <li>the ability to read and write HBOOK and <a
    href="http://root.cern.ch">Root</a> files 
   </ul>
  In addition, minor components provide support for Lorentz
  four-vectors, some miscellaneous numerical and functional-programming
  constructs, some XML support, etc.
  </p>

  <h3>Goals</h3>

  <p>My main goals in writing PyHEP are:
   <ul>
    <li><p>To produce Python software components necessary for HEP data
    handling and analysis.  </p></li>

    <li><p>To establish Python interfaces for common HEP functions and
    objects.  The interfaces should be fully "Pythonesque," not simply
    wrappers around existing C++ or Fortran APIs currently in use.
    </p></li>

    <li><p>To develop a system that allows very fast and convenient
    interactive use, and also provides a well-designed API suitable for
    writing self-documenting physics analysis scripts and software.
    </p></li>

   </ul>
  </p>

  <p>In addition, PyHEP is a test bed for some software experiments I've
  been thinking about for a while, including:
   <ul>
    <li>Using a functional programming style for implementing ntuple
    analysis.</li>
    <li>Using relational database terminology, concepts, and software
    for ntuple analysis and HEP event data handling.</li>
    <li>Designing visual styles for plots according to <a
    href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/">Edward R Tufte's</a> notions of
    information design.</li>
   </ul>
  </p>

  <p>To get a sense for PyHEP's capabilities and design, you may browse
  its documentation on line; see the download section below.</p>

  <h3>Reporting Bugs</h3>

  <p>Please send bug reports, requests, comments, complaints, etc. to
  the author, <a
  href="mailto:alex@alexsamuel.net"><tt>alex@alexsamuel.net</tt></a>.
  </p>

  <p>Any of these is considered a bug:
   <ul>
    <li>Variance among documentation, doc strings, and implementation.</li>
    <li>Missing documentation.</li>
    <li>An exception raised inside the PyHEP library for valid
    input.</li>
    <li>An exception or stack trace that does not contain useful
    information about fixing the problem.</li>
    <li>Any segv, abort, failed assertion, etc. that causes the Python
    process to terminate unceremoniously.</li>
    <li>Leaked memory or Python objects.</li>
    <li>Any unsolicited output to stdout or stderr.</li>
    <li>Behaviour that does not correspond to obvious expectations.</li>
   </ul>
  </p>
