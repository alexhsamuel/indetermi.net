<div class="title">Why Python?</div>

<p>Here, I give some of the reasons I think that Python would be a good
language for writing high energy physics software.  Currently, most such
software is written in C++, using the Root libraries and either a
compiler or the CINT interpeter; or in Fortran, using the CERNLIB
libraries and PAW application and either a compiler or the KUIP
interpreter.  I think Python is a better choice most of the time.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>I like Python.</b>

<p>I like programming in Python.  For several years it has been the
default language I choose for software projects.  I have used in the
past, and continue to use, C++, C, Java, Fortran, Scheme, Perl,
and others when the occasion calls for one of them, but I find that I
unless there is a specific reason to prefer one of these, I can get the
job done faster and more pleasantly in Python.</p>

<p>As a physics grad student, a lot of the code I write is for physics
data analysis and similar work.  I think I would be happier and more
productive using Python for these, too.</p>


<li><b>Dynamic languages are very effective for many programming
tasks.</b>

<p>High-level dynamic languages, like Python, Perl, and Lisp offer
efficiency advantages over low-level languages like C++ and Fortran.</p>

<p>High-level constructs, such as built-in container classes, iteration,
lambda expressions, and such allow programmers to implement the same
program in fewer lines of code.  This translates not only to less typing
and less time, but less debugging too.  These languages generally
include libraries with a great deal of useful functionality.  Since
these languages are often interpreted, interactive use is often
available and very handy for experimentation and testing.  </p>

<p>Weak typing makes it easy to write general purpose code that can be
used in unforeseen ways.  Instead of requiring "is-a" relationships, it
allows for interchangeability of objects with "acts-like" relationships.
This reduces code dependencies, and encourages programmers to think
about interfaces less in a programming sense (a big source of
hard-to-find bugs when working in languages like C++ that enfore type
safety but not semantic contracts) and more in a semantic sense.</p>

<p>Python's reference counting relieves programmers from tedious memory
management, which accounts for a big share of lines of code and bugs.
Sure, you can do this in C++, but there it has to be explicit (and is
still tricky in places), while in Python it is free.  Large datasets can
still be stored efficiently in memory using the <tt>array</tt> module or
an extension class.</p>


<li><b>Dynamic languages are faster than statically-compiled languages.</b>

<p>This is clearly a preposterous claim.  Or is it?  </p>

<p>For most physicists, I suspect the time it takes them to get results
they need out of a computer is dominated by coding and debugging time,
not execution time.  Compiled languages are optimized for the latter.
Given a choice between spending a week writing a C++ program that runs
in an hour, or spending a day writing a Python program that runs in four
hours, which would you pick?  Using C++ is advantageous only if the
program will be run very many times (for instance, event reconstruction
software).</p>

<p>In addition, it is a well-known fact that most software spends most
of its time in a fairly small fraction of its code.  By judicious use of
extension modules written in compiled languages (only <i>after</i>
profiling, of course!), the Python version can often be made to run in
the same time as the C++ version.  Then the setup, cleanup, bookkeeping,
input decoding, output formatting, glue logic, monitoring, etc. can be
written quickly and conveniently (and legibly!) in Python, without any
noticeable loss of run-time efficiency.  </p>

<p>High-level constructs and big standard libraries included in
high-level languages free programmers from having to implement
themselves efficient data structures and algorithms (which they are
often too lazy to do).  When hashed dictionaries, linked lists,
dynamically-sized arrays, efficient sorting, and fast domain allocation
are provided in the language, programmers are less likely to use
linear-time lookup, fixed-sized arrays, N^2 (or worse) sorting, and
gazillions of calls to malloc.</p>

<p>Dynamic languages also make it easy to implement certain kinds of
optimizations that are much more cumbersome in C++ or Fortran.  For
example, Python's built-in dictionaries, object properties, and the
ability to replace object attributes at run-time make caching
intermediate results very easy to implement.  Same goes for delayed
evaluation, often eliminates a great deal of computational work without
making code complicated.  Pickling makes it much easier to implement
persistent caching, too.  Such optimizations can make the Python version
run very much faster than the C++ version!</p.


<li><b>Python is easy to learn, easy to write, and easy to read.</b>

<p>One of Python's early goals was to be used as a teaching language.
It takes less time to learn to use Python effectively than it does for
other many other languages -- C++ to be sure, especially with STL
included.  Experienced programmers can learn a lot of Python very
quickly.  Often, they can read and understand the gist Python code
without any previous exposure.  Python's syntax is "Englishy" in much
the same way as Basic's, and Python's expression syntax resembles math
formulae in the same way as Fortran's.  Contrast this to the typical
Perl script, which to a non-Perl hacker looks only slightly better than
a sendmail configuration file.</p>


<li><b>Python is a stable and well-implemented language.</b>

<p>Python has been around for a while, and is a stable and
well-implemented language.</p>

<p>The Python language itself does change, but in a well-organized way.
The folks in charge of the language, Guido van Rossum and the other
principal Python developers, generally make good decisions.  Changes are
consistent with a well-thought-out set of principles and a coherent
style.  The language is forward-compatible.  The language and
differences among versions of it are clearly documented.  Deprecations
and changes in semantics are well-managed over multiple releases.</p>

<p>The implementation of Python is of high quality.  In years of working
extensively with Python, I have encountered very, very few bugs in the
interpreter or the standard libraries.  The language handles not only
correct cases, but incorrect input, and provides useful error messages.
Errors do not leave the interpreter in a broken state, so it is possible
to recover from them both when working interactively and in
programs.  The Python source code is clear (if you understand how
language systems work), well-documented, and tested.  Releases are
properly managed.</p>

<p>CINT, the quasi-C++ interpreter used in Root, suffers from
deficiencies that Python avoids.  It is unstable in many use cases,
especially when faced with ill-formed input.  This requires frequent
restarts of the interpreter, and often forces programmers to use strange
code constructs to avoid bugs and limitations.  


<li><b>Python uses the same interpreter when running interactively and
when running programs.</b>

<p>This guarantees the programs behave identically in both cases.  It is
common practice to try some code out interactively, and if it works out,
paste it into a file for use as a package.  This package can then trivially
be imported into an interactive session for testing.</p>

<p>While standard ANSI C++ is well-specified (overspecified?), CINT
implements a poorly-documented modified subset of the C++ language.
Therefore, standard C++ code often has to be modified for use with CINT.
Even programs originally written for Root often include preprocessor
directives that conditionalize code for CINT or a standard C++
compiler.</p>

<p>KUIP, the Fortran interpreter in PAW, also does not implement a
language identical to that of a Fortran compiler.  (How can it?  There
is a lot of variation among Fortran compilers.)</p>


<li><b>Python supports functional programming.</b>

<p>Many high energy physics software tasks are well-suited to functional
programming.  Our data are often represented by long sequences of
similar objects (events, particle candidates, tracks) on which the same
object is repeated sequentially.  Often, the sequences are combined in
complicated combinatoric arrangements.  A large fraction of analysis
code often consists of implementing iteration and managing the
combinatorics.  Traditional functional programming provides a much more
elegant and efficient representation than procedural programming.  In
addition, it is much easier for the system automatically to optimize the
functional representation than the procedural one.  </p>

<p>Python includes some nice features to support functional programming,
including iterators, generators, lambda expressions, closures, bound
methods, <tt>map</tt>, <tt>filter</tt>, <tt>reduce</tt>, and list
comprehensions.  Of course Lisp dialects are far better for functional
programming, but they are relatively inaccessible to those without the
advantage of a computer science education.  Implementing these things in
C++ requires an endless train of typographically-verbose template
classes, adapters, and function objects.  In Fortran?  Forget about
it.</p>
